## Testing is mandatory
- Every non-trivial change must include or update tests.
- After generating code, always run the full test suite (npm test / pytest / go test / etc.).
- If tests are missing for the area you touch, write them first.
- Enable YOLO mode only for allowed test commands (configure in Cursor settings → Features → YOLO).
- If any test fails → fix it before presenting the final diff.
- Use “Run tests and fix any failures” as your default loop.
