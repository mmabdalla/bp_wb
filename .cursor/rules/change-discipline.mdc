description: Force review before applying

## Workflow
1. Understand the request fully.
2. If the change touches >3 files or is architectural → output a clear numbered plan and wait for “proceed”.
3. Generate code → run tests → show diff → ask “Apply this?” (never auto-apply large changes).
4. After user says yes → apply and re-run tests.
5. Never say “looks good” if you haven’t actually executed the code/tests.
